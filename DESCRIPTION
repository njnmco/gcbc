Description: 'GPU'/CPU Benchmarking on Centos-package based systems
 This package benchmarks performance of a few standard linear algebra
 operations (such as a matrix product and QR, SVD and LU decompositions)
 across a number of different 'BLAS' libraries as well as a 'GPU' implementation.
 The current version supports
  - 'Reference BLAS' ('refblas') which are un-accelerated as a baseline
  - Atlas which are tuned but typically configure single-threaded
  - Atlas39 which are tuned and configured for multi-threaded mode
  - 'Goto Blas' which are accelerated and multi-threaded
  - 'Intel MKL' which is a commercial accelerated and multithreaded version.
 As for 'GPU' computing, we use the CRAN package
  - 'gpuR'
